# Introduction
Recently I started blogging. I create my websites with pelican and github pages. For content, I choosed to use markdown syntax to write. This blog records some helpful commands for writting.

<br />

# Markdown
## Insert picture
This command can insert picture into blog and adjust the picture size.
```text
![title](url){: .image-process-large-photo}
```

<br />

# Git
Remenber three steps when pushing:
```text
git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push origin branch_name
```
